# MeshRoute durable decisions

- **B197/B198 UI sleep/wake (design pending review, 2026-08-14):** an OLED build may light-sleep only after active-low
  button GPIO wake is armed and the panel is blanked, `InputFsm` is inactive, and `FrameGate` has no open logical
  frame. Non-OLED builds return `true`; retain DIO1/timer wake and one-page-per-service-pass rendering. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-b197-b198-ui-sleep-wake-design.md`.
- **Heltec V4 port (V4-4, 2026-08-26; metal validation pending):** `heltec_v4`, `heltec_v4_mobile` and
  `gateway_heltec_v4` support original
  high-power V4.2/V4.3 in 863–928 MHz, detects GC1109/KCT8103L at runtime with a fail-closed two-pull check, enables
  the V4.3 receive LNA, and supports nominal conducted 22 dBm via SX1262 drive 10 dBm. The two derived images add
  only the existing mobile or gateway role flags. Metal proves the shared OLED Vext contract is GPIO36 active LOW on
  both V4.2 and V4.3; the provisional HIGH level fails the V4.3 panel ACK. V4 R8/low-power/433–510, GNSS, calibrated
  power tables and runtime LNA control remain outside this slice. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-heltec-v4-radio-port-and-board-rf-seam-design.md`.
